# RexRelict_Olivine

This MATLAB code is adapted from Cross et al. 2017 for use with polycrystalliine aggregate olivine rocks, using the MTEX toolbox. Its purpose is to differentiate relict and recrystallized grains using grain orientation spread (GOS) thresholding and to calculate statistical data on the size of the grains. I adapted this code for our research of deformation conditions of Blue Ridge dunite bodies using EBSD-based paleopiezometry and slip system analysis for presentation at GSA Connects 2021.
